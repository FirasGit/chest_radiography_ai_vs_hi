## Train the model
In order to train the model you need to request access to our internal dataset or use your own dataset.
To train the model, run the following command

``` bash
python training/lightning_trainer.py meta.prefix_name=<your_preferred_run_name> model.name=<model_name> optimizer.learning_rate=<learning_rate> annotations.path_to_train_annotation_csv=<path_to_training_set> annotations.path_to_valid_annotation_csv=<path_to_validation_set> annotations.path_to_test_annotation_csv=<path_to_test_set> optimizer.loss_fnc=<loss_function> meta.batch_size=<batch_size>
```
